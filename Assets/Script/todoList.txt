TODO:

**1. Implement Cheato. Cheato is a robot that provides extra functions to player for easier level completion.
However, the implementation was not completed due to time constraints.

2. Add more diversity to levels. Current levels only consist of ground, wall, floating platforms, goal door
, enemies, and traps. New objects such as humans (if robot shoots human, then level lose) and helpful
items (like when pick up, invincible for a few seconds) can be added.

3. Provide more available functions and variables to players.

4. Improve the story of the game and the dialogue system to make the game more interactive.

**5.5 Show message instead of dying when player die in test run mode

6. Implement a score system instead of a hard time limit which makes players lose immediately if they cannot reach it.

**7. Convert HorizontalBlock to Block which have four variables x1, x2, y1, y2 each locate the start and
end of x & y, instead of just xStart, xEnd, and y.

**8. Check errors like when player jump to winning pos and player exit at the same time,
the win panel still pop up in transition back to coding scene, and level reached still increase





DONE:

5. When players are test running in manual mode, allow them to be invincible, so that they do not die and
respawn, because some levels might be too extreme for human to complete.
