    - We wait you for so long! Come, I will tell you how to use this to control our
      robots.
    - We use Lua as our programming language to control our robots.
    - If you don't know about it, don't panic. It is very easy to learn and we will
      guide you.
    - Anyways, let's start. You see the Robot button on the right? You'll see some
      general information about our robot and select what robot you want to use there.
    - The Function button contains each robot's functions and variables that are
      avaliable to use.
    - If you want to compile your code to see whether there is an error, you can
      press the Compile button.
    - You can test run the map by clicking the Test Run button. I suggest you to
      click it before you write your code to see the map.
    - You can click the Run button to run your code. Your code will be automatically
      saved.
    - You can click Enable console button to enable the console. The console is where
      the print() function prints to.
    - That's it! If you have any problem John will be there to help you.
